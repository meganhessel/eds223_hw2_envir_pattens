# **EDS 223 Homework Assignment 2**

Exploring patterns of environmental justice

### PURPOSE

This repository contains the EDS 223 homework assignment 2 where we practice checking and fixing CRSs, joining spatial data, creating summary tables, and developing tmap and ggplot visualizations.

The homework's content was examining redlining in Los Angeles, CA by diving into Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) grading system. We compared this grading system to various census conditions (such as percentage of low income, low life expectancy, and PM2.5) and number of bird observations.
